# API for BMI - exploration of an API service

This was an attamept to learn about API creation and use:

1. A user (usually programmatically) sends a http request to the host server hosted by app.py. 
   The url args contain the details of the ‘task’ the user has specified.
2. The server parses the url args and performs its required task. 
3. The server responds with an output in a machine friendly format, e.g: JSON.

bmi_package is a python package to make the use of the API easier, reducing barriers to use.

Note that the server is no longer online.
